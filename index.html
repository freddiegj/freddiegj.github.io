    <div class="main-text">
      <p>With over 7 years working in the hospitality and service industry,
          I have the skills to ensure that every project I
          work on is engaging, enjoyable, and professional.<br>
          I am a very creative person and love to share my ideas
           with others and help them achieve their vision in 
           whatever direction they like to go.
           <br>
           My main strength is working with people, and I try to channel that
           into the websites I write,
           making them readable and engaging for targeted audiences. I also 
           firmly belive that communication 
           is key to a good working team and I strive to bring that mindset 
          to evey project I participate in.</p>
